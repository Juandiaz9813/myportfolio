        <h2>Hello World, somethings About Me.</h2>
        <p> Hi! My name is Juan Esteban Diaz. I am originally from Colombia, but I am currently living in Guatemala.
            I am 27 years old and the purpose of this project is to show you what I've achieved during my studies as
            a software developer, as well as what I've done before deciding to change the direction of my life.
            Software development is something that has always sparked my curiosity, but I never tried it before—maybe
            because of fear. Now that I am learning to code, it's very satisfying to see how every day I understand
            more about this awesome world and industry. I know I still have a very long way to go, but I am excited
            about getting a job and learning even more while getting paid.  
            So… Hello, World!
        </p>
